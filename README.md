<p aligh="justify">Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Jason Garcia (<a href="https://etherscan.io/name-lookup-search?id=jjgarcia.eth">jjgarcia.eth</a>), an experienced and passionate Blockchain Developer specializing in DeFi and protocol design. I bring deep expertise in creating secure, production-grade smart contracts using cutting-edge development technologies like Solidity, Yul, Python, JavaScript, and Cadence, to name a few.</p>

<p aligh="justify">In my work, I've always strived to strike a balance between innovative problem-solving and meticulous execution. My projects, such as AnzaFinance, embody my commitment to leveraging blockchain technologies for meaningful, scalable solutions. With an ever-evolving tech landscape, I continually strive to stay ahead of the curve - learning new languages, exploring fresh concepts, and always looking for the next challenge.</p>

<p aligh="justify">In my professional experience, I have managed smart contract development for a startup with a multimillion-dollar enterprise customer, SW and HW maintenance of mature national assets, as well as development of flight test instructions for multi-million dollar complex UAV systems.</p>

<p aligh="justify">But it's not all about codes and contracts! I also love sharing my knowledge and learnings with the community. I've authored articles such as "Harnessing Foundry Cheatcodes: JSON Report Generation with Solidity" and "A Solidity Symphony: Testing Events with Foundry," aimed at aiding other developers in the blockchain space.</p>

<p aligh="justify">If you're interested in discussing blockchain development, DeFi, or protocol design, I'm always open to a good tech conversation. So don't hesitate to reach out!</p>

<p aligh="justify">Enjoy exploring my GitHub repositories, and feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/24-jason-j-garcia/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
